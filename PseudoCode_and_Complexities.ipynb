        "Insertion Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n²) due to the way it iterates and inserts elements into the sorted portion of the array. Let's break this down to understand why:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Outer Loop**: The algorithm iterates over each element in the array (except the first one, which is considered sorted by default). If there are `n` elements in the array, this loop runs `n-1` times.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inner Loop**: For each element, the algorithm then compares it with each element in the sorted portion of the array (the part of the array to the left of the current element). In the worst case, this means comparing it with every single element to the left. So, for the first element, it's 0 comparisons, for the second it's 1, for the third it's 2, and so on, up to `n-1` comparisons for the last element.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Nested Loops**: The inner loop is nested within the outer loop. This means for each element, you potentially have to compare it with each element in the sorted portion. The total number of comparisons in the worst case is the sum of the first `n-1` integers, which is (n-1)(n)/2. This formula is a simplification of the sum of a linear series and is proportional to n².\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Worst Case Scenario**: The worst-case scenario occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. Each new element considered has to be compared with all the other elements already sorted and then placed in its correct position. So, you end up with approximately (n²-n)/2 comparisons and swaps, which simplifies to O(n²).\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the O(n²) complexity comes from the fact that for each element, the algorithm may need to go through a number of elements proportional to the size of the array (in the worst case), leading to a quadratic relationship between the number of elements and the number of operations required."

        "1. **Divide and Conquer Approach**:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Dividing the Array**:\n",
        "   - The array of `n` elements is divided into two halves repeatedly. The depth of this division is logarithmic relative to the number of elements. Specifically, it will make `log n` divisions to reach the base case where each subarray has only one element.\n",
        "   - For example, for 8 elements, the division happens 3 times (8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1).\n",
        "\n",

        "   - After division, the algorithm starts merging these subarrays to produce sorted arrays. The merge operation for each level of the divided arrays takes O(n) time since it needs to look at every element (to merge them in order).\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Proportional to Input Size**:\n",
        "   - At any given time, the total amount of space used for these temporary arrays is proportional to the original array size `n`. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, you might need to store all elements of the array in these temporary arrays before merging them back into the original array.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Not In-Place**:\n",
        "   - Unlike some sorting algorithms (like Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort), Merge Sort does not sort the list in place. It requires this additional space, leading to a linear space complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Recursive Stack Space**:\n",
        "   - Additionally, if we consider the space used by the system call stack due to recursion, the space complexity remains O(n). The depth of the recursive call stack will be O(log n), but this does not dominate the space complexity, which is primarily dictated by the space needed for merging.\n",
